# Voice Activated Assignment Deadlines

An Alexa skill to tell you your assignmemt deadlines, just say "open assignment deadlines".

There is also a web application that can display the deadlines and configure the Alexa skill. For example, you can
- Add a nickname for your obscure course names: e.g. "Relational Databases" for "CPSC 304 101/102".
- Limit the timeline of due dates to annouce: e.g. "within 3 days" or "within 20 days".

This was created for UBC Canvas' API hackathon 2018, [here](/slides/Voice-Activation-Deadline-Hackathon-Presentation.pptx) are the presentation slides.
